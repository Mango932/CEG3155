# CEG3155 Fall 2024 - Digital Systems 2  

This repository contains labs, base components, and projects for **Digital Systems 2** at the **University of Ottawa**. All code is written in **structural VHDL** and is available for reference or reuse.  

## Usage  

All required components for the projects can be found in the `components` folder. To run a specific project:  
1. Create a new project in Quartus.  
2. Add the files in the projects folder name.
3. Include the necessary components from the `components` folder after trying to compile the project. It will tell you which ones are missing.  

The final grade for labs and projects was 100% so it should all work as intended.
